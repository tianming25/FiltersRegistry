! It looks like that PHPSESSID is checked on the server side
! I guess that it works like that - if specific PHPSESSID was registered and few/several seconds passed (I suppose 10 seconds or so)
! then it redirects to video content, otherwise it displays ads
! So, as a workaround a PHPSESSID is set to 1 for every video
! and it checks if the video content is available, if not, it tries again after 10 seconds,
! if it's available, it redirects to the video content
filstalwelle.de#$##mejsplayer:has(> video > source[src^="/video/content/a/"]) { display: none !important; }
