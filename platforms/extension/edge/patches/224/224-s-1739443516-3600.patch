! Rule below is required in case if DNS filtering is enabled.
! To play video website requires "cna" cookie (antiadblock/VPN message is displayed without this cookie)
! which is set by "https://log.mmstat.com/eg.js" script, but it's blocked on DNS level, so we need to set cookie manually.
! Original cookie value is the same as ETag value from "https://log.mmstat.com/eg.js" response, but it's not static.
! So as a workaround we use hardcoded value from "https://g.alicdn.com/kplayer/kuplayer/4.5.26-xmedia/index.js" script.
